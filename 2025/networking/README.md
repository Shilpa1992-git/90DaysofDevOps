# OSI & TCP IP models

 #  What is the OSI & TCP Model?
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)Model
TCP (Transmission Control protocol/Internet Protocol)Model
-> Model are fremeworks that explain how data travels over a network,such as the internet.The divide the communication process into different layers,each with a specific role.
# 7Layers of OSI Model
1. Physical Layer - Sends raw data as electrical signals or light.
   Example: Wi-Fi, Ethernet cabels,fiber optics.
   
2. Data Link Layer - Manages direct connections between devices using MAC addresses.
   Example: A switch connecting computers in a local network.
  
3. Network Layer - Handals IP addressing and routing data across network.
    Example: A router forwarding data based on IP addresses.

4. Transport Layer - Ensures reliable data delivery with error checking and flow control.
    Example: TCP (relible data),UPD (fast but no guarantee).
